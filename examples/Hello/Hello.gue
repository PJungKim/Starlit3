/**
  * Example Code "Hello, World!"
  * Designed By P. D. Starlit
  * Discription : This prints "Hello, World!" on the OLED layout.
  
  * GUE is the programming language for Embedded System.
  * So, Some keyboard is not assigned to the function BUTTON_Read().
  * So Some key will not operate. I think you may press Enter to end this program.
